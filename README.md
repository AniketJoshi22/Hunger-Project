Food demand Forecasting
Demand forecasting is a key component to every growing online business. Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand.
Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks â€” and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors.

In this project we've done exploratory data analysis to find out the trends in the food demand, what factors affects the number or orders from a restaurant and developed a model to predict the number of orders for a given week.
